## Description

Web app that allows users to input numbers on a keypad and returns predictive text.

## Live Website

## Approach

I followed TDD for implementing the algorithm on the back end. See my approach here ...

- API endpoint returns array of strings when given a numeral string
- Logic is implemented in back end service
- MVP consists of an input numbers and list of predictions on the front end and 1 api endpoint on the backend

## Technologies Used

- Main technologies:
- Suggested: Node, React, redux
- Additional: [Styled components](https://reactjs.org/): For its modular / component css that makes styling react components very easy.

## Getting Started

In terminal and desired file location:

```
git clone git@github.com:HarryMumford/T9.git
cd T9
npm i
```

## How to Run the app

TBC
